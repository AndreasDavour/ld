VERSION 0.98.1 - Initial release.
  This version is sufficient to run a single Lambda at reduced speed.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  * The need-fetch bit is inoperative. Every macroinstruction causes a fetch.
    This incurs a heavy speed penalty.
  * SM clock stepping is incomplete, meaning many debugging and diagnostic
    functions will fail.
  * Cache is not implemented. This also incurs a speed penalty.

VERSION 0.98.2
  This version is sufficient to run a single Lambda at reduced speed.

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  * The need-fetch mechanism is now working properly, as far as we can tell.
  * The RTC's RAM is now saved between runs, making it possible to change
    the site timezone without Lisp complaining
  * In situations where both Linux tuntap and BPF are available,
    tuntap is used. This prevents a conflict.
  * The telnet socket used for the SDU serial port has SO_REUSEADDR set.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  * SM clock stepping is incomplete, meaning many debugging and diagnostic
    functions will fail.
  * Cache is not implemented. This incurs a speed penalty.
