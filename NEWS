VERSION 0.98 - Initial release.
  This version is sufficient to run a single Lambda at reduced speed.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  * The need-fetch bit is inoperative. Every macroinstruction causes a fetch.
    This incurs a heavy speed penalty.
  * SM clock stepping is incomplete, meaning many debugging and diagnostic
    functions will fail.
  * Cache is not implemented. This also incurs a speed penalty.
